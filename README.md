# Jetpack Compose Sandbox

This is a sandbox project where I'm testing all kinds of android jetpack compose libs, views and
other
things.

## Getting Started

I will split all my experiments in specific flows (data/domain/ui - for each case).
Bellow you will find all the flows that I will test and you can extract them if you like.

## Flows

These are all the features implemented and tested.
